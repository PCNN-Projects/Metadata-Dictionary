# Metadata-Dictionary

This repository contains the metadata template developed for the Post-COVID Netwerk Nederland (PCNN) research consortium. This structured template can be used to collect metadata from post-COVID cohort studies and has been used to do so for Dutch cohort studies as part of the PCNN. The metadata file includes key information on study design, participants, outcomes, and methods of measurement. The goal is to create an online metadata dictionary, providing valuable insights into the long-term effects of COVID-19.

## Repository Structure

- `codebook.xlsx` â€“ Main file containing all variables, themes, labels, ontology mappings, and value codings.
- `themes_and_subdomains.md` â€“ A categorized list of all Themes and Subdomains used in the codebook.
- `instruments_overview.md` â€“ Summary of all validated instruments and questionnaires represented in the codebook.

## Purpose

This codebook was designed to:
- Enable standardized data harmonization across studies.
- Facilitate ontology-based mapping (e.g., SNOMED CT, LOINC, NCIT).
- Help researchers explore, select, and reuse variables relevant to their analyses.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- A number of variables and FAIR ontology mappings are currently under internal and external review. These elements will be gradually refined and expanded in subsequent releases, based on expert input and consortium-wide feedback.
- Future updates will include the addition of new instruments such as **Beighton Score** and **FUNCAP-27**, as well as expanded support for structured metadata.
