# Metadata-template

This repository contains the metadata template developed for the Post-COVID Netwerk Nederland (PCNN) research consortium. This structured template can be used to collect metadata from post-COVID cohort studies and has been used to do so for Dutch cohort studies as part of the PCNN. The metadata file includes key information on study design, participants, outcomes, and methods of measurement. The goal is to create an online metadata dictionary, providing valuable insights into the long-term effects of COVID-19.

## Repository Structure

Within the 'docs' file, the 'Metadata bestand.xlsx' containts the template that can be used for post-COVID studies. 

---

## Purpose

This metadata template was designed to collect metadata from post-COVID studies in a standardized manner, and thus support harmonization. The purpose of the metadata dictionary is to:
- Map ongoing and completed post-COVID cohort studies in the Netherlands. 
- Facilitate collaboration, by making it easier for researchers to identify overlaps and gaps in research.
- Promote data reuse.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- A number of variables and FAIR ontology mappings are currently under internal and external review. These elements will be gradually refined and expanded in subsequent releases, based on expert input and consortium-wide feedback.
- Future updates will include the addition of new instruments such as **Beighton Score** and **FUNCAP-27**, as well as expanded support for structured metadata.
